GW Homework #14

## Eat Da Burger!

In this assignment, I have created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I made sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Demo

Eat Da Burger is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out here: https://young-falls-93196.herokuapp.com.

## Installation

To install the application follow the instructions below:
git clone https://github.com/JenniferFunchess/burger-handlebars.git
cd Burger
npm install
